👋 Hello, I’m James, born and raised in North Carolina, US. I started college a few years ago for my associates in Information Technology/Web Development and Computer Programming but I have recently transferred to WGU for my Bachelors in Software Development.

👀 I’m interested in software engineering, programming, cybersecurity, robotics, and AI. I'm really interested in starting a career in tech. I've always loved technology.

🌱 I am currently increasing my skills as a web development/computer programmer. I am interested in learning as many languages as possible. So far I've worked on HTML/CSS/JS, C++, Java, and Python. 

💞️ I have never collaborated on a project before but I think it would be a fun learning experience. I would be happy to collaborate on anything so if you're browsing my profile and looking for someone to help, even if it's something really minor, I want to!

📫 You can reach reach me at my email, jatk187@wgu.edu or through one of the links.

P.S. I'm still finding my way around Git and Github.
