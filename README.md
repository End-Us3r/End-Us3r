👋 Hello, I’m James, born and raised in North Carolina, US. I'm in college for my associates in Information Technology/Web Development and Computer Programming. I have about a year to go until I finish and starting to get a little excited with finally obtaining my first degree.

👀 I’m interested in software engineering, programming, cybersecurity, robotics, and AI. I'm really interested in starting a career in tech as I have always loved the potiental of technology.

🌱 I am currently increasing my skills as a web development/computer programmer. I am interested in learning as many languages as possible. So far I've worked on C++, Java, some HTML/CSS and some Python. C++ was my first coding language and I really liked it, though I lost alot of my old C++ projects :(

💞️ I have never collaborated on a project before but I think it would be a fun and learning experience. I would be happy to collaborate on anything so if you're browsing my profile and looking for someone to help, I want to!

📫 You can reach reach me at my student email: atkinsj5352@student.faytechcc.edu P.S. I'm still finding my way around Github
