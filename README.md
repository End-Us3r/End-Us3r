### 🧠 About Me
I'm a former hands-on worker (construction, fishing, manufacturing) turned aspiring software engineer, currently studying at Western Governors University. I love solving real-world problems with clean code and intuitive design.

💡 *What first hooked me?* A C++ class back in 2019.  
🔧 *What keeps me going?* The challenge of learning and the joy of building things that work.

### 🔭 I’m currently working on:
- Sharpening my Python and SQL skills  
- Data visualization projects  
- Web apps with modern front-end frameworks  
- Diving deeper into game development and AI
