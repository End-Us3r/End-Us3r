👋 Hello, I’m James, born and raised in North Carolina, US. I started college a few years ago for my associates in Information Technology/Web Development and Computer Programming but I have recently transferred to WGU for my Bachelors in Software Development.

👀 I’m passionate in technology, mainly programming, cybersecurity, and robotics. I am currently increasing my skills as a web developer/software developer. So far I've worked on small projects that use HTML/CSS/JS, C++, Java, and Python. 💞️ I have never collaborated on a project before but I think it would be a fun learning experience. 

📫 You can reach reach me at my email, jatk187@wgu.edu

I'm still learning how to use Git and Github.
