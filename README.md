ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m James! I'm still in college striving to earn my Bachelor's in Software Engineering. One day!

  Anyway, I like learning about Web Development and AI, interested in learning more about Cybersecurity and Game Development. 
  
  I would love to gain experience collaborating on projects with others so hit me up if you're looking for the same! It's a learning experience, right?
  
  Find me on LinkedIn or Codecademy!
