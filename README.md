👋 Hello, I’m James! I'm currently in college striving to earn my Bachelor's in Software Engineering!

👀 I’m passionate about technology, cybersecurity, and robotics.

💞️ I love learning about all things I.T. 

📫 You can reach me at my student email, jatk187@wgu.edu

P.S. I haven't used GitHub as much as I should have in the past but that changes this year!
